Debug this issue: {{$1}}

Follow systematic debugging process:

## 1. Understand the Problem
- What is the expected behavior?
- What is the actual behavior?
- When did it start happening?
- Can you reproduce it consistently?

## 2. Gather Information
- Read error messages carefully
- Check logs for relevant entries
- Review recent changes
- Identify affected code paths

## 3. Form Hypotheses
- List possible causes
- Rank by likelihood
- Consider edge cases

## 4. Test Hypotheses
- Add logging/debugging output
- Test each hypothesis systematically
- Eliminate possibilities

## 5. Fix and Verify
- Implement fix
- Test thoroughly
- Verify no regressions
- Document the issue

## 6. Prevent Recurrence
- Add tests for this scenario
- Improve error messages
- Update documentation
- Consider monitoring/alerts

Provide detailed analysis and actionable recommendations.
